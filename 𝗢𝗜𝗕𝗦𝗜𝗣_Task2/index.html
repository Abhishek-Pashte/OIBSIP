            <p>
                <b>Stephen William Hawking </b>was an English theoretical physicist,
                cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of
                research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University
                of Cambridge. Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of
                Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious
                academic posts in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stephen Hawking was regarded as one of the most brilliant theoretical
                physicists in history. His work on the origins and structure of the
                universe, from the Big Bang to black holes, revolutionized the field,
                while his best-selling books have appealed to readers who may not have
                Hawking's scientific background. Hawking died on March 14, 2018, at the
                age of 76. Stephen Hawking was seen by many as the world's smartest person,
                though he never revealed his IQ score.
